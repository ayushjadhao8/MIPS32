# MIPS32
 High-Performance MIPS32 Processor with Smart Caching
 • Designed a MIPS32 processor with a five-stage pipeline and an advanced two-level cache system (L1 & L2) for
 optimized memory access.
 • Enhanced instruction execution efficiency by integrating caching mechanisms, reducing latency, and improving
 performance.
 • Implemented branch prediction and hazard handling to minimize stalls and improve throughput.
